Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called ████, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the ████ys in lime when
they're dead, █████ would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.

According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths,
this next issue of The Last █████ focusses on lime... and to no one's
surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our
Master of ████, █████ .

Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this
next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise
to some.

Me ?  My curiosity is piqued and am itchin' to see this ████y
issue of The Last █████ and if you are afflicted with the same and
do not yet subscribe, it may not be too late:
